The system should be able to include multiple semesters, print-outs of schedules, and scheduling preferences. 
 The system as a whole and all components must be tested thoroughly
Base user class
  students – can register, can see available courses and their own schedule.
  instructor – can see available courses and their own course roster.
  admin – can see everything, can edit courses/users/schedules.
Students  will be able to see all instructors and classes and create a schedule
  Display a list of all instructors – ID, first name, last name, CRN
  Course numbers and CRN, course name, times, and instructor
Implement and test these requirements.
Database 
  Python based of MySQL would work to create a strong database
  Features multiple CPUs  to function making it more fast and reliable
UI (user interface) - leopard web and another option
  Leopard web features what we need but can remove all the extra features
  Financial aid, e-bill, etc. only use the required things 
  Tknitor is also another option that can be seen for the UI due to Python being implemented already and being an easy-to-understand language. 
Development and integration
  -Get opinions from outside use and implement new features
  -alerts and modification of scheduling, etc
  -keep stable performance and connection.
