Component Analysis
-Existing software
	-LeopardWeb
		-Created by Ellucian Company
		-Works and meets all of the listed requirements (for students, unknown due to lack of access as an instructor/admin)
		-Relatively slow due to extra features outside of the requirements for new database

Requirement modifications
-Modify to be used with less users (100 students, 10 instructors, 1 admin)
-Separate/remove features not listed in the requirements for new database
	-E-Bill
	-Financial aid
	-Proxy access
-Revamp UI to be more user-friendly and navigable?

System design
-Reused parts with minimal modifications
	-User information database
	-Course information database
	-Scheduling systems
-Remove extra features
-Performance improvements

Development and integration
-After switching from LeopardWeb to the modified version, take feedback from users and use it to improve upon the system further
	-Potentially bringing back old features if requirements are modified, but try to keep improved -performance
	
/* comments - Zain siddiqi
   I like the overall idea of using leopardweb itself as a backbone to provide all the requirements that we need to meet. We can also improve on leopardweb itself 
   due to the low server speeds by removing some unnecessary features. */
